However, the diff does not show the new image assets being added to the bundle (and specifically does not evidence presence of both …-2.png and …-3.png).",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added static asset files (Added: 0). Only the Hero component reference was changed to point to the -2.png path; there is no evidence that either image file (especially -3.png) was added to the repo/bundle under /assets/uploaded/.",
